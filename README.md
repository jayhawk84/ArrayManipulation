# ArrayManipulation
These are some simple array manipulations I wrote on my own without using any in-built C# functions.  
There was a lot of trial and error here and a bunch of scrapped code, but I'm happy that so far all the class methods pass the unit testing.

I have successfully written some UnitTests for all of these as well, and I'm really happy they all pass.
